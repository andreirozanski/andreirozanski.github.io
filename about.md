## On Science:

I work in bioinformatics and I am passionate about genomics, transposable elements (the main topic of my Ph.D. thesis) and transcriptomics.

Also, I am interested in multi-species comparison/analysis at genomic and transcriptomic level, pipelines and reproducibility.

Currently I am working at <a href="https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mpi-bpc</a> trying to learn more about regeneration and species diversity.


## On Computers:

I am a linux fan with special interest in HPC and virtualization.
